The Open-Closed Game

Rules of the game:

This game is played between two players.

One player will be the predictor.

To play the game, after a count of three, the players will need to simultaneously show their hands with each hand either open or closed, and the predictor need to shout out how many hands they think will be open on total.

If the predictor is correct, they win, otherwise the other player becomes the predictor and they go again. This continues until the game is won.

## How to play

For each round, the computer will expect player input in the following format if you are the predictor:

```
OC2
```

Or if you are not:

```
CO
```

That is, the first two characters will show how you will play your hands, O for open or C for closed. If you are the predictor, you also need to enter a third character which is your prediction for how many open hands in total.

The program should then reveal the “AI” players input and indicate if the game was won, or move to the next round.
